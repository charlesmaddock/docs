## Get your API keys

First, let's get an Dendrite API key from the [dashboard](https://dendrite.systems/app).

You'll also need an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) API key. We use their LLMs to complete certain task, so make sure you have valid API keys.

You can use the keys in your code or have them in a `.env` file like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
DENDRITE_API_KEY=
```


## Installation

Install the Dendrite SDK. We also need to run `playwright install` to install the browser drivers.

With pip:
```
pip install dendrite-sdk && playwright install 
```

With poetry:
```
poetry add dendrite-sdk && poetry run playwright install 
```


## Hello world

For our first Dendrite script, let's start the `DendriteBrowser`, go to google.com and enter "hello world" into the search field:

```python main.py
import asyncio
from dendrite_sdk import DendriteBrowser


async def hello_world():
    # You need to provide an Open AI key and an Anthropic key.
    openai_api_key = "..."
    anthropic_api_key = "..."

    # Get your Dendrite API get from Dendrite.systems.
    dendrite_api_key = "..."

    # Initate the Dendrite Browser
    browser = DendriteBrowser(
        openai_api_key=openai_api_key,
        anthropic_api_key=anthropic_api_key,
        dendrite_api_key=dendrite_api_key,
    )

    # Navigate with `goto`, which returns a 'DendritePage' that controls the current page.
    page = await browser.goto("https://google.com")

    # Get elements from the current page with `get_element`.
    search_bar = await page.get_element("The search bar")
    
    # Let's enter hello world into the search bar.
    await search_bar.fill("hello world")


asyncio.run(hello_world())
```


## Extract Google Search Results
