With our Chrome extension, **Dendrite Vault**, you can safely collect user sessions from your browser and simulate an authenticated session in the Dendrite Browser.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the extension">
    First, add Dendrite Vault to your browser. On install, you will be prompted to authenticate
    with your personal Dendrite account. See the steps below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save auth session">
    Go to any website where you're currently authenticated. Click on the
    extension icon and press **Save authentication session**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Once your session has been saved, you can add it to your browser context
    with:

    ```python
    browser.authenticate("domain.com")
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

The extension isn't available on the Chrome Web Store right now, but here is how you can use it anyways:

## Install Extension

https://github.com/dendrite-agent/dendrite-vault

You can download it as a zip file by pressing the green 'code' button.

## Activate Extension

Once you have downloaded the build you need to load it as an extension. Do this by going to 'chrome://extensions', you should see this:

The extension should be available as an extension in your browser. You might need to activate it inside 'chrome://extensions'. 

If you press the extensions button next to the search bar in your browser, you can open Dendrite Vault and start authenticating sessions for your agent by simply pressing the "Save Authentication Session" button, given that you are logged in to the service you want your agent to have access to:

You'll need to log in to your Dendrite account first before your can start authenticating.
