title: Extract Google Results
description: "Let's extract some search results."

## Google Search

In the example below we instanitate the `DendriteBrowser`, navigate to google, find the search bar, enter "polar bears" and press enter.

```python main.py
import asyncio
from dendrite import DendriteBrowser


async def google_search_videos(query: str):
    # You need to provide an Open AI key and an anthropic key.
    openai_api_key = "..."
    anthropic_api_key = "..."

    # Get your Dendrite API get from dendrite.systems.
    dendrite_api_key = "..."

    # Initate the Dendrite Browser
    browser = DendriteBrowser(
        openai_api_key=openai_api_key,
        anthropic_api_key=anthropic_api_key,
        dendrite_api_key=dendrite_api_key,
    )

    # Navigate with `goto`, which returns a 'DendritePage' that controls the current page.
    page = await browser.goto("https://google.com")

    # Get elements from the current page with `get_element`.
    search_bar = await page.get_element("The search bar")
    
    # Let's enter the search query into the search bar.
    await search_bar.fill(query)

    # Press enter to search
    await page.keyboard.press("Enter")

# Search for polar bears
asyncio.run(google_search_videos("Polar bear"))
```

## Extracting video result URLs

To showcase Dendrite's **extraction functionality**, let's click the 'videos' tab once we have made the search and extract all the video urls as a list of strings:

```python main.py
# ... Previous code above

    # Get the video tab to see video results
    video_tab = await page.get_element("The tab for showing video results")
    # Click the video tab
    await video_tab.click()

    # Extract all the video URLs.
    urls = await page.extract(
        "Get all the urls of the displayed videos as a list of valid urls as strings"
    )
    
    for url in urls:
        print("url: ", url)


asyncio.run(google_search_videos("Polar bear"))
```

The `extract` function takes a while to run and it can consume a lot of tokens. This is because an AI agent is inspecting the HTML and writing code to extract the requested data. 

However, once the function has ran successfully once, it is **cached**. This means that subsequent calls only run the script (until the script fails, in which case a new script is generated).

Here is the entire script:

```python main.py
from dendrite import Dendrite
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import time

# Load the Dendrite API key from env
load_dotenv()

def google_search_videos(query: str):

    # Initate the Dendrite Browser
    browser = Dendrite()

    # Navigate with goto. This returns a 'DendritePage' that represents the current page.
    browser.goto("https://google.com")

    # Get elements from the current page with `get_element`.
    search_bar = browser.get_element("The search bar")
    # Let's enter the search query into the search bar.
    search_bar.fill(query)

    # Press enter to search
    browser.press("Enter")

    # Wait for the new page to load
    time.sleep(1)

    # Get the video tab to see video results
    browser.click("The tab for showing video results")

    # Extract all the videos URLs
    urls = browser.extract(
        "Get all the urls of the displayed videos as a list of valid urls as strings"
    )
    for url in urls:
        print("url: ", url)

google_search_videos("Polar bear")
```
