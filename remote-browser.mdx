## Scaling up

The local `DendriteBrowser` is great for development, but if you want to start scaling up you might want to use a hosted browser instead. We currently support Browserbase as provider.

## Browserbase

To get started you'll need to head over to [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) and create an account. Get both the Project ID and API Key and save them in your .env file like this:


```bash .env
# ... previous keys 
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=
BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=
```

To start using the the remote browser you just need to change the import and and browser initialisation to use the `BrowsebaseBrowser` class instead.


```py
# from dendrite_python_sdk import DendriteBrowser
from dendrite.ext.browserbase import BrowserbaseBrowser

...

# browser = DendriteBrowser(...)
browser = BrowserbaseBrowser(
    # Include the previous arguments from DendriteBrowser
    browserbase_api_key="...", # or specify the browsebase keys in the .env file
    browserbase_project_id="..."
)

...
```

<Note>You can use the remote browser just as you would the local `DendriteBrowser`. The only difference is that the browser is running in the cloud.</Note>

### Proxy and downloads

You can active rotating proxies by setting `enable_proxy=True` when creating the `BrowsebaseBrowser`. The proxies are provided by Browserbase and you can track your usage on their website.
 
To be able to download files you have to set the `enable_download=True` when instantiating the `BrowsebaseBrowser`.

<Warning> If you have enabled downloads it is important that you call `browser.close=()` when you're done. Otherwise the Browserbase session will continue until it timeouts.</Warning>
