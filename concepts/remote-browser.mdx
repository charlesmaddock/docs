## Scaling up

The local `Dendrite` browser is great for development, but if you want to start scaling up you might want to use a hosted browser instead. We currently support Browserless and Browserbase as provider.

## Browserless

To get started you'll need to head over to [Browserless](https://www.Browserless.io/) and create an account. Get the API Key and save them in your .env file like this:


```bash .env
# ... previous keys 
BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=
```

To start using the the remote browser you just need to specify the remote_config argument when initiating `Dendrite`. Import the `BrowserlessConfig`  as following `from dendrite.remote import BrowserlessConfig`.


```py
# from dendrite_python_sdk import DendriteBrowser
from dendrite.remote import BrowserlessConfig

browser = Dendrite(remote_config = BrowserlessConfig())
async_browser = AsyncDendrite(remote_config = BrowserlessConfig())
```

<Note>You can use the remote browser just as you would the local `Dendrite` browser. The only difference is that the browser is running in the cloud.</Note>


## Browserbase

To get started you'll need to head over to [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) and create an account. Get both the Project ID and API Key and save them in your .env file like this:


```bash .env
# ... previous keys 
BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=
BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=
```

To start using the the remote browser you just need to specify the remote_config argument when initiating `Dendrite`. Import the `BrowserbaseConfig`  as following `from dendrite.remote import BrowserbaseConfig`.


```py
# from dendrite_python_sdk import DendriteBrowser
from dendrite.remote import BrowserbaseConfig

browser = Dendrite(remote_config = BrowserbaseConfig())
async_browser = AsyncDendrite(remote_config = BrowserbaseConfig())
```

<Note>You can use the remote browser just as you would the local `Dendrite` browser. The only difference is that the browser is running in the cloud.</Note>

### Proxy and downloads

You can active rotating proxies by setting `enable_proxy=True` when creating the `BrowserbaseConfig`. The proxies are provided by Browserbase and you can track your usage on their website.
 

<Warning> When using Browserbase as provider it is extra important that you call `browser.close=()` when you're done. Otherwise the Browserbase session will continue until it timeouts.</Warning>
