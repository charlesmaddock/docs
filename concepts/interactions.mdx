## Interaction basics

Dendrite enables easy web based actions for AI agents. With the Dendrite client, you can create workflows that match the way a human would act in a browser, using intuitive tools like `click` and `fill`, all with natural language.

Here are the core methods used when interacting with web pages through the Dendrite client:

- `click` for clicking on the described element
- `fill` for filling a field with some value
- `fill_fields` for filling multiple fields in a form
- `press` for simulating a keypress

## Creating Interactions

When creating a web interaction function for your AI agent, we recommend doing the action manually in your own browser first and breaking it down in steps. For example:

1. Navigating to mail.google.com (and making sure you're signed in)
2. Clicking on the button for creating new email
3. Entering the recipient email
4. Writing the subject line
5. Writing the email content
6. Pressing the send button

These steps will inform how you can instruct your agent to follow the same steps on any website.

### Writing code

The next step is to write the code. The example above would translate to something like this:

```python
from dendrite_sdk import Dendrite

def send_email(to, subject, message):
  # Initiate Dendrite instance and authenticate
  client = Dendrite(auth=["mail.google.com"])

  # Navigate and check for successful authentication
  client.goto("https://mail.google.com/", expected_page="Gmail inbox")

  # Create a new email and populate fields
  client.click("New email draft button")
  client.fill_fields({
    "Recipient": to,
    "Subject": subject,
    "Message": message
  })

  # Send email
  client.click("The button for sending the email")

send_email(
  "john@doe.com",
  "Who are you",
  "Why does everyone mention you in their code all the time?"
)
```

In the above example, we create the `send_email` function that takes in `to`, `subject` and `message` as arguments. This tool would then be passed on to an agent to be used by its function calling abilities.

The tool uses the Dendrite client to perform the actions in the browser, just like a human would. This gives you infinite flexibility to modify your agent's behaviour, without being limited by traditional REST APIs.
