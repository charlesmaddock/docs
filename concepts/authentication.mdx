Our **Dendrite CLI** enables you to securely to share your website permission with your AI agent, mirroring the access you have in your local browser. Everything is stored locally ensuring that no one else other than you has access to the authenticated sessions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run Command">
    First, run the following command in the terminal `dendrite auth --url <url>` where url is the website you want your agent to be authenticated against. For example `dendrite auth --url mail.google.com`. This will open up a browser at that url.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login and Save Auth Session ">
    In the newly opened browser login into the service. When you are done go back to the terminal where you ran the command and press enter to save the seession.
    extension icon and press **Save authentication session**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate in Script">
    Once your session has been saved, you can use it in your Dendrite browser like this:

    ```python
    Dendrite(auth="domain.com")
    Dendrite(auth=["domain1.com", "domain2.com"])
    ```
