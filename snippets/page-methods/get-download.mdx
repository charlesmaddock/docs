**Usage**

```python
# Download the file and get a reference to it
browser.click("Download File")
download = browser.get_download(timeout=5000)

# Save the downloaded file to the suggested location
download_path = "path/to/file/" + download.suggested_filename
download.save_as(download_path)
```

**Arguments**

- `timeout` (float, optional): The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the download to complete. Defaults to 30000.

**Returns**

- `Download`
