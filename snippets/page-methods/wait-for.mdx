### wait_for

Waits for the condition specified in the prompt to become true by periodically checking the page content.

This method retrieves the page information and evaluates whether the specified condition (provided in the prompt) is met. It continues to retry until the total elapsed time exceeds the timeout.

**Usage**

```python
try:
  browser.wait_for("Loading to complete", timeout=10000)
  # continue with page interactions
except PageConditionNotMet as e:
  print(f"Condition was not met before timeout: {e.message}")
```

**Arguments**

- `prompt` (str): The prompt to determine the condition to wait for on the page.
- `timeout` (float, optional): The maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait for the condition. Defaults to 30000.

**Returns**

`True` if condition is met before timeout.

**Raises**

`PageConditionNotMet` if condition is not met before timeout
