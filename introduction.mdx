---

Dendrite is an open-source framework that makes it easy to build web agents that actually work. Instead of focusing on building a fully autonomous agent Dendrite is built to create web agents that make atomic actions reliably. 

- 👆🏼 Interact with elements
- 💿 Extract structured data
- 🔓 Authenticate on websites
- ↕️ Download/upload files

Dendrite consists of a browser wrapping around Playwright and a logic engine that generates scripts for extracting content and selectors for interacting with elements in a deterministic and repeatable manner.
