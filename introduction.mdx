description: "What is Dendrite?"
---

Dendrite is an open-source framework that makes it easy to build web agents that actually work. Instead of focusing on building a fully autonomous agent Dendrite is built to create web agents that make atomic actions reliably.

* üëÜüèº Interact with elements

* üíø Extract structured data

* üîì Authenticate on websites

* ‚ÜïÔ∏è Download/upload files

Dendrite consists of a browser wrapping around Playwright and a logic engine that generates scripts for extracting content and selectors for interacting with elements in a deterministic and repeatable manner.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Notice:** For better performance and reliability, use the async API over the sync API.
