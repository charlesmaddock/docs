## Browser library

The Dendrite library is an abstraction on top of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro). You can do everything you would normally do with Playwright but with additional functionality made for AI Agent development.

## AI functionality

Use natural language to find an element on the page or scrape information in a structured format. Scripts will be generated on the fly using Large Multimodal Models and will be cached for quick and affordable future use. If a script breaks due to a change in the DOM, it will self-heal automatically and cache the new modified script.

## Authentication

You can simulate an authenticated user session on any website by using our chrome extension **Dendrite Vault**. This allows your AI Agent to use a web service on your behalf without being dependent on an API. Read more about authentication [here](/authentication).
