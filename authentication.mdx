With our chrome extension, **Dendrite Vault**, you can safely collect user sessions from your browser and simulate an authenticated session in the Dendrite Browser.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the extension">
    First, add Dendrite Vault to your browser. On install, you will be prompted to authenticate
    with your personal Dendrite account. [Get it
    here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions?hl=en-US)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save auth session">
    Go to any website where you're currently authenticated. Click on the
    extension icon and press **Save authentication session**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Once your session has been saved, you can add it to your browser context
    with:

    ```python
    browser.authenticate("domain.com")
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

When you save an authentication session in Dendrite Vault, it retrieves the session cookies in your browser and saves it to your dendrite account. When you authenticate with `browser.authenticate("domain.com")`, the cookies from that domain will be loaded in the browser context and allow your AI Agent to access that website using your account.
